# Overview

Super apps, serving as centralized platforms that manage user information and integrate third-party miniapps, have revolutionized mobile computing but also introduced significant security risks from malicious miniapps. Despite the mandatory miniapp vetting enforced to the built-in miniapp store, the threat of evolving miniapp malware persists, engaging in a continual cat-and-mouse game with platform security measures. However, compared with traditional paradigms such as mobile and web computing, there has been a lack of miniapp malware dataset available for the community to explore, hindering the generation of crucial insights and the development of robust detection techniques. In response to this, this paper addresses the scarcely explored territory of malicious miniapp analysis, dedicating over three year to identifying, dissecting, and examining the risks posed by these miniapps, resulting in the first miniapp malware dataset now available to aid future studies to enhance the security of super app ecosystems.

To build the dataset, our primary focus has been on the WECHAT platform, the largest super app, hosting millions of miniapps and serving a billion users. Over an extensive period, we collected over 4.5 million miniapps, identifying a subset (19, 905) as malicious through a rigorous cross-check process: 1) applying static signatures derived from real-world cases, and 2) confirming that the miniapps were delisted and removed from the market by the platform. With these identified samples, we proceed to characterize them, focusing on their lifecycle including propagation, activation, as well as payload execution. Additionally, we analyzed the collected malware samples using real-world cases to demonstrate their practical security impact. Our findings reveal that these malware frequently target user privacy, leverage social network sharing capabilities to disseminate unauthorized services, and manipulate the advertisement-based revenue model to illicitly generate profits. These actions result in significant privacy and financial harm to both users and the platform.

# Dataset Release
To mitigate malware threats on mobile platforms (e.g., Android) and engage the research community to better our understanding and defense, we are happy to release our dataset to the community.

### Dataset Release Policy
To mitigate malware threats on mobile platforms (e.g., Android) and engage the research community to better our understanding and defense, we are happy to release our dataset to the community. However, to avoid this dataset from being misused, we feel the need to have some sort of authentication in place to verify user identity or require necessary justification, instead of making the dataset completely public. For that purpose, if you are interested in getting access to our dataset, please read the following instructions carefully -- before sending us emails.

### Instruction on Requesting the Malware Dataset
##### (1) If you are currently in academia:
(a) If you are a student (or postdoc), please ask your advisor (or host) to send us an email for the access. If you are a faculty, please send us the email from your university's email account.

(b) In your email, please include your name, affiliation, and homepage (if we do not know each other). The information is needed for verification purpose. Note that your request may be ignored if we are not able to determine your identity or affiliation. Again, please send us the request from your university's email account.

(c) If your papers or articles use our dataset, please cite our Oakland 2012 paper as follows.

Yuqing Yang, Yue Zhang, and Zhiqiang Lin, "Understanding Miniapp Malware: Identification, Dissection, and Characterization," The Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium, 2025

##### (2) If you are currently in industry (including research labs):

(a) Please send us an email from your company's email account. In the email, please briefly introduce yourself (e.g., name and title -- in case we do not know each other) and your company.

(b) In the email, please attach a justification letter (in PDF format) in official letterhead. The justification letter needs to acknowledge the MiniMalware project from The Ohio State University and state clearly the reasons why the dataset is being requested. Also, acknowledge that the dataset will not be shared to others without our permission.

We emphasize that we will ignore emails that do not follow the above instructions. Note that we may disclose the list of universities, research labs, companies that have requested our dataset on this webpage. Again, you are not allowed to share any samples in our dataset to others without our permission. Sending us the email for our dataset access implies that you are aware of and agree with the above policies.

Please send your request emails to Yuqing Yang (yang.5656@osu.edu) AND Dr. Zhiqiang Lin (zlin@cse.ohio-state.edu) with "[MiniMalware Samples Request]" in the subject.
